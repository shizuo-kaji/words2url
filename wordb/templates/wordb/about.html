<em>Words2URL</em> is a simple service that associates your favourite <em>Word</em> to <em>Data</em> such as
URL, text, and short HTML.
</p>
<p>
Type "google" and you are taken to the famous search engine, as expected.<br>
Type "penguin" if you like the birds.
</p>
<p>
Our service is meant to be used, for example, as a shared/personal bookmark, 
a pointer to your product page,
an online business card, and an online meeting URL opener.
</p>
<p>
You do not have to memorise a complicated URL but just keep your favourite Word.
<br>
You do not have to text a long URL but just tell your Word in person or over the phone.
<br>
Your tweet looks nicer with Word than with a cryptic URL with a lot of %'s.
</p>
<p>
It is similar to the QR code but requires no camera or paper. 
All you need is your voice to tell Word.
<p>
<em>Word-Data</em> pairs can be registered at <a href="{% url 'ask'%}">Ask page</a> on a first-come-first-served basis.
Each Word is valid only for a certain period.
The period can be extended at <a href="{% url 'update'%}">Edit page</a> using <em>Editkey</em> chosen at the creation time.
The associated <em>Data</em> can also be modified in the same manner.
</p>

<p>
Technically, it returns pure text for a GET request like '?query=Words' so that it can be used as a certain API.
For example, you can store XML and retrive from your service.
We hope to see interesting applications.
